# xbox-games-with-gold-claimer-testing

No code yet, but this repo is a placeholder for notes and hopefully in the future will consist of a way to automatically claim xbox games with gold.

This URL lists information about the current games with gold. https://reco-public.rec.mp.microsoft.com/channels/Reco/v8.0/lists/collection/GamesWithGold?itemTypes=Game&DeviceFamily=Windows.Xbox&market=US&language=EN&count=200

Need to use the IDs form the URL above to pull more information about the games.

A branch of xbox python web api project has this endpoint in one of the scripts. https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-webapi-python/blob/feature/store_endpoint/xbox/webapi/api/provider/store.py

Feel free to contribute if you know how to automatically claim the games using python.
